# AI-Powered CLI Development for Non-Coders

Building command-line tools used to require years of programming experience. Not anymore. With AI assistants like ChatGPT, Ghostwriter, and Replit Agent, anyone can create powerful CLI applications from scratch.

## The Reality Check

I'm not a programmer. I don't have a computer science degree. But I've built functional CLI tools that solve real problems using nothing but AI assistance and determination.

## Tools That Changed Everything

- **ChatGPT**: For initial code generation and debugging
- **Replit Ghostwriter**: Real-time coding assistance
- **Replit Agent**: End-to-end project building

## What You Can Build

Start with simple utilities and work your way up to complex automation tools. The key is breaking down problems into small, manageable pieces that AI can help solve.
