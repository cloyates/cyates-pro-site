# CLI Starter Kit: Your First AI-Assisted Command Line Tool

Starting CLI development can feel overwhelming. Where do you begin? What structure should you use? This minimal starter kit removes the guesswork and gets you building immediately.

## What's Included

The cli_starter kit provides a foundation for any command-line application:
- Argument parsing setup
- Error handling patterns
- Configuration file management
- Testing framework basics

## Getting Started

1. Clone the starter template
2. Describe your tool's purpose to an AI assistant
3. Replace placeholder functions with your logic
4. Test and iterate

## Why This Approach Works

Instead of learning programming fundamentals first, you start with a working template and modify it. AI assistants handle the complex parts while you focus on solving your specific problem.

## Real Examples

Users have built:
- File organization tools
- API testing utilities
- Data processing scripts
- System monitoring dashboards
